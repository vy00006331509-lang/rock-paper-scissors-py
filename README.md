A classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game built with Python. Features a user-vs-computer interface where the computer makes random moves. Great for beginners learning Python conditional logic.
# 🪨📄✂️ Rock Paper Scissors - Python Game

A simple command-line implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. This project allows a user to play against the computer, which selects its moves randomly.

## 📝 How It Works
The game follows the standard rules:
* **Rock** smashes Scissor
* **Paper** covers Rock
* **Scissor** cuts Paper

## 🚀 Features
* **User Input:** Prompts the player to enter their move (Rock, Paper, or Scissor).
* **Randomized Opponent:** The computer uses Python's `random` module to choose unpredictably.
* **Win/Loss Logic:** Comprehensive `if/elif` statements handle all game scenarios (Win, Loss, or Tie).
* **Feedback:** Prints clear messages explaining the result (e.g., "Paper covers rock, You win").

## 💻 How to Run
1.  Ensure you have Python installed.
2.  Clone this repository or download the file.
3.  Run the script in your terminal:
    ```bash
    python "rock paper scissor.py"
    ```
4.  Enter your choice exactly as shown: `Rock`, `Paper`, or `Scissor`.
